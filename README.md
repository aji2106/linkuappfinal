	b. Activate the environment 
```sh
$ WINDOWS: activate environmentname 
$ LINUX, macOS: source activate environmentname
```
2. **pip install** -r **requirements**.**txt** : This is the phase where necessary components of the app are installed 
3. **python manage.py makemigrations**
4. **python manage.py runserver** : runs the app
5. **open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**
