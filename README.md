# How to install and run locally?

1. Install a virtual environment such as [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
	a. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.6 (Refer to [cheat sheet in case stuck](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf))
	b. Activate the environment 
```sh
$ WINDOWS: activate environmentname 
$ LINUX, macOS: source activate environmentname
```
2. **pip install** -r **requirements**.**txt** : This is the phase where necessary components of the app are installed 
3. **python manage.py makemigrations**
4. **python manage.py runserver** : runs the app
5. **open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**

Notes: localhost version please use SQLite, it may need configuration of API keys too.
